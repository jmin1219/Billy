# Tax Residency Research (2025 Transition Year)

## 1. The Verdict
- **Status:** **Deemed Non-Resident**
- **Effective Date:** Aug 23, 2025 (Arrival)
- **Authority:** Canada-Korea Tax Convention (Article 4 - Tie-Breaker Rules)

## 2. The Logic (The Algorithm)
1.  **Domestic Level:** I am a *Factual Resident* (Fresh Start Rule) because I have a lease and bank account.
2.  **Treaty Level:** I am a *Dual Resident* (Resident of Korea via Domicile/Family + Resident of Canada via Ties).
3.  **The Tie-Breaker:**
    - Permanent Home? **Tie** (Both available).
    - Centre of Vital Interests? **Korea** (Family + Main Assets/ISA are there).
    - **Result:** Treaty overrides Domestic Law -> **Deemed Non-Resident**.

## 3. Financial Implications (The Rules)
- **Korean ISA:** **Tax Exempt** in Canada. (Canada has no jurisdiction over foreign-source income of non-residents).
- **T1135 (Foreign Assets):** **Exempt.** (I am not a "reporting entity").
- **TFSA / FHSA:** **FORBIDDEN.** 
	- *Critical:* I cannot open these accounts. Penalty is 1% per month.
    - *Action:* Cancel any plans to open Scotiabank FHSA.

# The 2 Minute Friction Test

**Tags:** #systems #psychology #friction #productivity

## The Heuristic
When you feel resistance to a task (e.g., "I don't want to code"), do not force yourself to do the *task*. Instead, ask:
> **"Can I just stand at the starting line?"**

## The Algorithm
1.  **Identify the Start:** What is the absolute first physical action? (e.g., "Open VS Code").
2.  **The Timer:** Do that action for 120 seconds.
3.  **The Permission:** After 2 minutes, if you still hate it, **you are allowed to stop.**

## Why It Works
* **Physics:** Static friction coefficient > Kinetic friction coefficient. It takes more energy to *start* moving than to *keep* moving.
* **Psychology:** It lowers the stakes from "Build the Feature" (Scary) to "Open the Terminal" (Easy).

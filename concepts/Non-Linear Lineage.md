# Non-Linear Lineage

## 1. The Core Concept
History and innovation are not linear stories ("A led to B"). They are **Dependency Trees** (DAGs).
- **The Myth:** The "Lone Genius" (Newton/Einstein) who invents from scratch.
- **The Reality:** Innovation is an `import` statement. You import existing modules (ideas) from other fields and compile them into a new executable.
    - *Example:* ImageNet (Fei-Fei Li) = `import Psychology (Biederman)` + `import Crowdsourcing (Amazon Turk)`.

## 2. Application to "Billy"
- **Old Strategy:** "Sculpting" (Trying to force myself to work linearly).
- **New Strategy:** "Gardening" (Managing the ecosystem of inputs).
- **The Architecture:** Billy must track the *Parent Nodes* (Context/Inputs), not just the *Leaf Nodes* (Tasks). A task without context is a compilation error.

## 3. Source
- **Origin:** [[Fei-Fei Li Interview]] (2025-12-10).
- **Related:** [[Stochastic Resonance]] (Noise as a necessary input for signal detection).

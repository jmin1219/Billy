## 1. Hardware State (Bio-Metrics)

- **Sleep Duration:** 6.36 hours (🔴 Low Battery)
- **Nocturnal HRV:** 44.1 ms (⚠️ Stressed/Recovering)

## 2. Context (The Software)

_Use the 'Interviewer Agent' to fill this._

## 2. Context (The Software)

- **Input:** [[Fei-Fei Li Interview]] (Source: YouTube)

  - **Insight:** History is not a linear story, but a **"Non-Linear Lineage"** (Dependency Tree).
  - **Connection:** This validates the "Billy" architecture -> We need to map _Inputs_ (Causes) to _Outputs_ (Effects).

- **Input:** [[Tax Residency Research]] (Source: Deep Research)

  - **Status:** **Deemed Non-Resident** (Tie-Breaker Rule: Vital Interests in Korea).
  - **Decision:** Do NOT open FHSA (Penalty Risk). ISA is tax-exempt in Canada.
  - **Outcome:** "Adulting" anxiety resolved.

- **Action:** Built [[Billy Data Pipeline]] (Python)
  - **Tech Stack:** `xml.etree` (Streaming Parser), `datetime`.
  - **Result:** Successfully parsing Apple Health XML.
  - **Metric:** Found 2505 Sleep Records.

## 3. Output (The Work)

- [x] Engineered `pipeline.py` (XML Parsing -> Markdown Generation)
- [x] Flesh out the [[Non-Linear Lineage]] concept note.
- [x] LeetCode Maintenance: "Find the Duplicate Number"
    - **Concept:** Floyd's Cycle Finding (Tortoise & Hare).
    - **Insight:** Array Indices = Pointers. `nums[i]` is the "next" node.
    - **Trap:** Phase 2 must reset `fast` to `0` (index), not `nums[0]` (value), or the math breaks.
    - **Status:** Passed.

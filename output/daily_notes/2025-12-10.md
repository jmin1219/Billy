## 1. Hardware State (Bio-Metrics)

- **Sleep Duration:** 6.36 hours (🔴 Low Battery)
- **Nocturnal HRV:** 44.1 ms (⚠️ Stressed/Recovering)

## 2. Context (The Software)

Here's a summary of our conversation in Dependency Node format for Obsidian:

-   **Input:** [[Hardware State/Low Battery]] (6.36h sleep) -> **Insight:** User's system shows signs of strain, impacting resilience.
-   **Input:** [[Hardware State/Stressed HRV]] (44.1 ms) -> **Insight:** Body indicates stress or recovery demands.
-   **Input:** [[Mental State/6-7 out of 10 Focus]] -> **Insight:** Moderate current mental energy, boosted by recent rest.
-   **Input:** [[Mental State/Dopaminergic Urge]] -> **Insight:** Strong intrinsic motivation towards Project Billy and human-AI learning.
-   **Input:** [[Bio-Metrics/Unplanned Nap]] -> **Insight:** Indicates unacknowledged fatigue, successfully addressed.
-   **Input:** [[Environment/Gloomy Weather]] -> **Insight:** Acknowledged external factor influencing mood/energy.
-   **Input:** [[Big Ideas/Co-op Recruitment & Portfolio Development]] -> **Insight:** Key future-oriented tasks causing potential stress.
-   **Input:** [[Big Ideas/Human-AI Learning & North Star]] -> **Insight:** Core intellectual and strategic drivers.
-   **Input:** [[Friction Points/Anxiety & Overthinking]] -> **Insight:** Primary blockers leading to "infinite planning" and fear of project stagnation.
-   **Input:** [[Action/Commitment to Shipping]] -> **Insight:** User's chosen strategy to combat overthinking is to prioritize tangible delivery.
-   **Input:** [[Action/Verify Daily Note Save]] -> **Insight:** Immediate, specific action taken to prove "shipping" a working tool.


- **Input:** [[Fei-Fei Li Interview]] (Source: YouTube)

  - **Insight:** History is not a linear story, but a **"Non-Linear Lineage"** (Dependency Tree).
  - **Connection:** This validates the "Billy" architecture -> We need to map _Inputs_ (Causes) to _Outputs_ (Effects).

- **Input:** [[Tax Residency Research]] (Source: Deep Research)

  - **Status:** **Deemed Non-Resident** (Tie-Breaker Rule: Vital Interests in Korea).
  - **Decision:** Do NOT open FHSA (Penalty Risk). ISA is tax-exempt in Canada.
  - **Outcome:** "Adulting" anxiety resolved.

- **Action:** Built [[Billy Data Pipeline]] (Python)
  - **Tech Stack:** `xml.etree` (Streaming Parser), `datetime`.
  - **Result:** Successfully parsing Apple Health XML.
  - **Metric:** Found 2505 Sleep Records.

## 3. Output (The Work)

- [x] Engineered `pipeline.py` (XML Parsing -> Markdown Generation)
- [x] Flesh out the [[Non-Linear Lineage]] concept note.
- [x] LeetCode Maintenance: "Find the Duplicate Number"
    - **Concept:** Floyd's Cycle Finding (Tortoise & Hare).
    - **Insight:** Array Indices = Pointers. `nums[i]` is the "next" node.
    - **Trap:** Phase 2 must reset `fast` to `0` (index), not `nums[0]` (value), or the math breaks.
    - **Status:** Passed.
